# MTA-GB - GameBoy emulator in Multi Theft Auto
This project aims to create a fully playable GameBoy emulator within Multi Theft Auto.

## Loading ROMs
At this stage it is not possible to dynamically decide which ROM to load. Instead it is currently hardcoded to run the Tetris ROM but this can be adjusted in **src/core.lua**. This ROM is _not_ included in this repository.
